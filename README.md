# Web Mole Game

Mole game with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. (Web-based)

- Get all the **CSS** and **HTML** on the page. Have ten holes with a hungry mole in each. No JS done yet.
- Make the moles show up and disappear (don't worry about the sad face / butt yet.) Don't make them clickable yet, just have them disappear and reappear after a random interval.
- Make the hungry moles clickable. If you click on one, add 1 point to your score.
- After 10 clicks, show the win screen.
- Show the worm meter. As a player clicks on moles, show more and more of the worm.
- Make one in ten of the moles that show up a royal mole. If a user clicks a royal mole, add 2 points to their score.
- If a user doesn't click a mole in time, show a sad mole.
- If a user does click a mole in time, show a fed mole.
- After both sad and fed moles, show a mole butt.
- You're done!
